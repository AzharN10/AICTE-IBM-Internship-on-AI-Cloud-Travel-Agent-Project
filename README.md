# AICTE-IBM-Internship-on-AI-Cloud-Travel-Agent-Project
AICTE IBM Internship on AI &amp; Cloud by Edunet Foundation
This repository contains the implementation of a Travel Planner AI Agent developed during my internship with IBM Cloud and AI. The agent is designed to assist users in planning personalized trips based on their preferences, budget, and travel constraints. Built using IBM WatsonX.ai, the system leverages real-time data integration and natural language understanding to suggest destinations, create itineraries, recommend transport and accommodation, and provide weather updates. The solution is deployed on IBM Cloud, utilizing its scalable and secure infrastructure to deliver a seamless, intelligent travel planning experience.
